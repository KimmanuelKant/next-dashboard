# THINGS TO DO:

## UI/UX:
**1. Tooltips on column view dropdown items**
    ```bash
    When hoovering a column in the "show/hide"-dropdown, there should be a tooltip describing what the column shows. This needs to also work on mobile, so my first instinct is to add a little "info" button that is clickable, and will open a small overlay describing the different columns.
    ```

**2. About this page-div on src\app\page.tsx**
    ```bash
    Bootstrap Accordian dropdown on the frontpage with "about" info, describing the webpage. I assume this will improve search engine visibility?
    ```

## Features


**1. Awards page** 
    ```bash
    Display a page full off bootstrap cards, showcasing various "awards", and maybe a toggle between weekly and seasonal
    ```

**2. User Log In**
    ```bash
    Implement a user database and allow users to log in, connecting the account with a user and giving you acces to all your minileagues.
    ```

**3. Chat**
    ```bash
    A league specific chat for each league. It should be visible for everyone, but you need to be logged in to send a message.
    ```
